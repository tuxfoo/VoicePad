VoicePad

The main goal of voicepad is to be able to use voice packs with Star Citizen.
At the moment I am trying to get Kate from HCS voicepacks to work.

Each voice pack will need a custom json configuration.

First thing I want to do is get voice recognition and chit chat working.
There will be a option to use both a online and offline speech engine.

After speech recognition and chit chat are working, the second goal will be to get commands to work,
I have used python to automate stuff inside games before so it should be possible.
